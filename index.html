                <p>hi! i'm lúcio moreira. i'm currently living in an extremely small city in southeastern brazil while
                    on leave from stanford,
                    where i study computer science on the biocomputation track.
                </p>
                <p> lately, i have been interested in a lot of things that I didn't have the opportunity to explore
                    while i was living in the u.s.a., like continental philosophy, psychoanalysis, cooking, and lifting.
                    i'm also working towards an associate's degree in foreign trade from a brazilian university.</p>
                <p> i'm excited about tackling intriguing challenges. if you're exploring projects where my skills could
                    come
                    in handy, don't hesitate to get in touch. i'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations
                    that align with my interests.
                </p>
