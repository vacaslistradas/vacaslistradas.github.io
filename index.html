            <p>Every sport has that one magical moment that everyone, even those who aren't fans, can marvel at in highlight reels. For soccer it would be an unlikely goal from their best striker, and for American football it would be the touchdown – for baseball, it's unquestionably the home run.</p>
            
            <p>While we dare not diminish the aura of a goal or a touchdown, we would argue that there's something a bit special about home runs, owing mostly to the nature of hitting a ball that is going very fast: it's hard. Hitting successfully in just 25% of your chances makes you a pretty decent player. Hitting in 30% of your chances makes you one of the best players in any given season. Hitting in 40% of your chances makes you one of the best players in all of baseball history, which began in the 1800s. These percentages, by the way, correspond to any type of hit, not just a home run – the home run is a lot rarer and accounts for only around ~13% of all hits in the 2016 season (5626 home runs with 42478 total hits).</p>
            
            <p>So in a statistical sense at least, there is something interesting about home runs. We decided that we wanted to use a dataset that contains every single play of every single game in the 2016 MLB season to try and figure out what can lead to a home run.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Venue Analysis</h2>
            <p>And so began our journey into this mildly terrifying dataset. As you can imagine, it's sort of difficult to know where to start, especially when there are so many different data points for each play of every game. We figured that diving in headfirst would be the best approach, and the first thing we noticed is that there is a spike in home runs during night time. This turned out to not be especially surprising by itself, since most games for any given stadium are played at night. However, we noticed a spike around 8pm local time for quite a few of the stadiums.</p>
            
            <div id="viz2-container" class="viz-container"></div>
            
            <p>In our data wrangling, we initially noticed a spike around 8pm local time where home runs are especially common for most of the MLB stadiums. Our initial thought was that this was correlated with something like air temperature or air pressure. However, since air pressure increases as it gets cooler in the night, and since it's harder to hit a ball further with higher air pressure, this theory seems unlikely at face value. Rather, we suspect that it has more to do with the lighting of the stadium or something intrinsic to the game itself than it does with any aspect of climate. Indeed, 8pm is around sunset time for these stadiums during the season, and so we started to look around for other evidence to see if we could find anything else interesting that might shed some light on this correlation with time (pun intended).</p>

            <p>What we instead discovered, however, upon visualizing the data by home run rate, is that on a per stadium basis, there isn't much of a correlation with home run rate and time of day. And so while we've ended up in quite a different place than where we started, we narrowed our ideas down to a general bucket of causes: the state of the game at the time the home run was hit.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Game State Analysis</h2>
            <p>We immediately thought to look at the relative time of the game at which the home run was hit to see if that would be more highly correlated with home runs compared to the absolute local time of the venue. To do this, we found the top 14 home run hitters in 2016 and looked at the inning in which they hit their home runs. The inning is essentially a unit of "time" in a baseball game – a normal game has 9 innings, but a game will go past 9 if there is a tie and won't end until the tie is broken.</p>
            
            
            <div id="viz1-container" class="viz-container"></div>
            
            <p>When looking at the top 14 players, there isn't a huge correlation that is obvious based on the data alone, except for a peak in home runs (generally) around the middle of the game, especially the 4th inning. Indeed, looking at all home runs in 2016 confirmed that most home runs are hit in the middle of the game (innings 4-7), with fewer home runs hit in innings 2-3 and 8-9. The first inning, however, is an interesting outlier both in our dataset of 14 players as well as the raw total of home runs by inning. The only 2 innings with more home runs are the 4th and 6th innings.</p>
            
            <p>This is definitely an interesting find – we would have guessed for there to be a stronger positive correlation between inning number and home run count since we were seeing some correlation with time. We think that the best way to explain the anomaly of the first inning is that pitchers are very likely less dialed in when the game first begins, leading to a higher number of pitches that are easier to hit further. As for the peak around the middle of the game with a tapering off towards the end of the game, we figured that this trend was probably better explained by the state of the game rather than some extrinsic factor like time or weather.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Ball-Strike Analysis (Game State Part 2)</h2>
            <div class="definition-box">
                <p><strong>Strike zone:</strong> the zone in 3D space where the pitcher has to throw the ball</p>
                <p><strong>Ball:</strong> a pitch thrown outside the strike zone</p>
                <p><strong>Strike:</strong> a pitch thrown inside the strike zone, or a pitch that a hitter swings at regardless of location</p>
            </div>

            <p>In any given at-bat the pitcher needs to throw 3 strikes to get the batter out. But if they throw 4 balls, the hitter gets to walk to base in what is called a base on balls.</p>

            <p>It seems pretty intuitive that there would be some differences in how likely it is for a home run to be hit, since the ratio of balls to strikes would be a rough measure of who has the advantage. If there are more balls than strikes, that means the hitter has the advantage, because they have more opportunities to hit the ball. Conversely, if there are more strikes, the pitcher has the advantage, since the hitter has fewer opportunities to hit the ball before they are out.</p>

            <div id="viz3-container" class="viz-container"></div>

            <p>So, we wrangled the data and found some very interesting trends. Unsurprisingly, the ratio of balls to strikes (or "count") with the highest home run percentage is the one where there is the greatest difference between balls and strikes, which is 3 balls and 0 strikes. Equally unsurprisingly, the count that has the lowest home run percentage is the one with the greatest difference between strikes and balls, which is 0 balls and 2 strikes. The trends get more interesting in the less extreme cases, however.</p>

            <p>Aside from the counts where the hitter or pitcher is favored, another thing to notice is that the home run percentage drops as you compare the 0-0, 1-1, and 2-2 counts. This trend also holds for any counts that have equivalent differences between balls and strikes, e.g. 1–0 vs 2-1 vs 3-2. But how can this be if all are equal differences in balls vs. strikes? We postulate that the hitter feels the pressure as the at-bat progresses and misses more often, leading to a lower home run percentage as a direct result.</p>

            <p>We felt a bit unsatisfied by just the home run percentage by count, and so we did some more wrangling to figure out how often a player swings at a pitch for each ball and strike ratio. Interestingly, although home run percentage decreases as the overall number of pitches in the at-bat increases, hitters swing a lot more frequently as the number of pitches increases. This would seem to be confirmation of the idea that the "quality" of hitting decreases as the at-bat goes on – it isn't simply that the hitter isn't swinging.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Baseball is often romanticized as a game of raw power or athletic skill, but our exploration into the 2016 MLB season revealed a far more nuanced narrative. It's clear home runs are an interplay of game context and psychological dynamics.</p>

            <p>Our analysis uncovered layers of complexity behind what might seem like only hitting a ball very hard. We hope we were able to show you that variables related to game state have more of an impact on home run hitting than some extrinsic factor such as lighting or weather, as best we can tell. Indeed, the surprising prevalence of first-inning home runs coupled with a peak in home runs towards the middle of the game show that they aren't correlated very well at all with any factor that changes relatively linearly over time. Perhaps most intriguingly, the relationship between ball-strike counts demonstrates that hitting a home run is as much a mental game as a physical one. As the at-bat progresses, the mounting psychological pressure visibly impacts a player's performance, with swing frequencies and home run probabilities shifting in intricate patterns in and out of favor with the hitter and pitcher.</p>

            <p>These findings show us that baseball is a game of countless variables. Each home run represents a beautiful mix of skill, intuition, and a decent share of luck.</p>
